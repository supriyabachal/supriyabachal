## 🧠 About Me

I’m an **AI Engineer** working at the intersection of **machine learning, large language models (LLMs), cloud infrastructure,public-interest technology and AI Governance **.

My work focuses on:
- Scalable AI systems (FastAPI, Docker, AWS, SageMaker)
- LLM evaluation, monitoring & reliability
- Federated learning & edge AI
- Civic-tech and volunteer coordination platforms

I enjoy turning **complex AI ideas into deployable, real-world systems**.
